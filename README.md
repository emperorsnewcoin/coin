# 👑 Emperor's New Coin (ENC)

*The first cryptocurrency that proudly promises to decrease in value!*

## About

Emperor's New Coin (ENC) is a groundbreaking Solana-based cryptocurrency that dares to ask the question: "What if we made a token that's exactly as 'reliable' as fiat currency?"

ENC is proudly committed to following the M2 money supply metrics published by the Federal Reserve. When they print, we print. It's that simple.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create a 1:1 reflection of the M2 money supply changes in token form
- Educate people about monetary policy through satire
- Have fun while making a serious point about currency debasement

## 🏦 How It Works

1. We monitor the Federal Reserve's M2 money supply data through FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
2. When M2 goes up, we mint more ENC
3. That's it. That's literally it. We just keep printing.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

- Built on Solana (because if you're going to make a currency, it should at be fast and cheap to transfer)
- Integrated with Switchboard oracles for M2 supply data
- Fully automated money printer that goes "brrr"

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

- This is not financial advice
- This is literally anti-financial advice
- If you buy this token expecting it to maintain its value, you haven't been paying attention

## 🎨 The Art Project

Emperor's New Coin is an artistic statement about:
- The nature of value
- The current state of monetary policy
- The emperor's stunning new wardrobe
